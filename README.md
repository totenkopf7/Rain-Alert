# Rain Alert
This is a fun and useful Python tool, it will send you an email every day at a specific time to tell you how is the weather for the next 12 hours, e.g: Sunny, cloudy, and rainy, in case you are not a Python user nor have you any idea about coding, you can modify the time to your preference in line 53, where I set it to 60 seconds.

# Usage
* To get an API_KEY, just register in this website: https://www.openweathermap.org and open https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys to generate and copy your API_KEY
* To get LATITUDE and LONGTITUDE of your country/city, you can use this website: https://www.latlong.net/
* Paste the API_KEY, LATITUDE, and LONGTITUDE in the Python code and run it

# Note 
If you use gmail service for this matter, you need to allow third party apps to have access to your gmail, how are you going to achieve that:
* Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
* Use Two-Step-Authentication and enable it.
* Create an App Password, Select App > Mail | Select Device > Windows Computer.

# Weather Codes
Weather Codes file (docx) is encluded in the repo, you can see them and modify the Python file accordingly, however, I only used "Rainy, Cloudy, and Sunny" codes.

# Run 
You need to have Python installed on your machine and then open command line, cd to the file directory and type: python Rain_ALert.py
